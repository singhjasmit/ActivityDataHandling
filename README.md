# ActivityDataHandling
Passing data between activities

The project demonstrates three differents patterns:
- Calling activities without any data 
- Calling activity and passing data to the second activity
- Calling activity with data and expecting to handle data on return from the second activity
- Passing a Serializable object
- Passing a Parcelable object
